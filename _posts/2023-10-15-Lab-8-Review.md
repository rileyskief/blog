The easiest part of completing the tutorial was definitely the beginning, since you just copy & paste into your terminal to create the Razor Page. I ran into many issues after that. Because the Microsoft Entity Framework updated to 8.0.0, I initially was just specifying the version when downloading packages to use in this lab; however, I realized that it was difficult to determine when I had to specify the version, so I decided to just download 8.0.0 to my laptop. This was 100% the right move, but that also meant I had to start over- good thing I wasn't to far into the tutorial yet.

When creating my own application in step 2, it took time to understand the kinds of errors I was getting. They were always SQLite errors, which I know had to do with my database, but I wasn't sure how to fix it. It occurred after adding a new column to my "books.cs" file, but I knew that I needed to make those changes. Suddenly, I realized that I could open DB Browser and view the database from there to see what is missing. I made some changes, and my application started working!

What parallels and differences do I see between the Jekyll framework and the Razor framework? I think the way that they're both presented, as in what the user uses, is very similar looking. Not indentical, but similar. As for code, they both use different file types. The Jekyll framework uses a lot of markdown and .html files whereas the Razor framework uses a lot of .cshtml, .cshtml.cs, .json, etc. Overall, I view the Jekyll framework a lot simpler to use compared to the Razor framework. Though, I am very confident in creating another Razor application, despite it taking me a great deal of time to figure out and complete, with lots of help from office hours!
