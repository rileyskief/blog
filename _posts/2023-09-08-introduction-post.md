My setup experience with this lab did not go as smoothly as I had hoped, though I have enjoyed learning the ways to do everything. I like the creativity aspect of creating a blog post. Everything, truly, was new to me- [Github](https://github.com/), [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/Visual), the concepts used to create and understand how to create a blog. I struggled the most with downloading Ruby and Jekyll onto my laptop and finding out why my laptop initially rejected it. I am still trying to understand what all of the files in the Blog program contribute to the website. I am looking forward to becoming more proficient and confident in completing labs like this.
