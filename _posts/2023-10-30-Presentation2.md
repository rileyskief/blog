title: Reflection on Mockups!
author: Riley Skief
---

My personal role in the team project so far is working with my team members to find a time that a majority of us are free to meet and progress in the project. We have only had a few meetings so far, mostly over Teams due to travel, though we have used our time in class well to work through any questions not able to be answered apart. We completed a majority of our mockups in class following the demonstration, and today, after presenting to our peers, we made the suggested changes from them and Dr. Goadrich. I plan to continue to assist my team in scheduling our meetings, but most importantly help begin creating our basic working webpages and implementations.
