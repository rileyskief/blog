Compared to my work on Lab 8, this lab went much more smoothly. Ifelt way more comfortable with Razor Pages and scaffolding folders. I liked that this lab had a practical use- not that lab 8 didn't, but just that as a student, I see many course schedules and things like that, and it was fun to see how things like that can be created.

The easiest parts of the lab was definitely creating the new files/folders and doing the scaffolding of those folders. The confusing part was pagnating and sorting, though it gave me the code for doing this. Reading the code once implemented made sense, I was just unsure of how to do it before looking at the tutorial. It was very cool!

What was difficult about working with multiple tables in this lab? I had a few SQL errors, which I eventually figured out, but it began when new tables were created. I resolved this issue by looking at the tables in DbBrowser to better understand. I can see how working with one table may be easier, but I honestly didn't find using multiple to be too difficult.

I feel very prepared to create my team project for my client. Similar to this lab, my final project will require multiple tables to hold information from the multiple forms. It is also taking similar information, such as name, age, and the dates of various things. The only difference is what they are going to be used for. My project will be used for helping provide for people on the verge of homelessness or house those who already are homeless.

Overall, this lab was very informative and interesting! I like using the Microsoft Tutorials to learn new things.
