My dog, Ginger, is a [peekapoo](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/peekapoo). Peekapoos are a mix between a poodle and a pekingese dog. She loves to do tricks, and even has her own [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/mollie.and.ginger/?hl=en)! She will be turning 5 this September!

She loves going on walks, steamed broccoli, and she will forever love her sister, Mollie, who was a boxer. She's very vocal, loves to sunbathe, and always wants to be next to someone.
