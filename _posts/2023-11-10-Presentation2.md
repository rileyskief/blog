title: Reflection on Presentation 2!
author: Riley Skief
---

My team members and I have been communicating well through teams and working on things through there, as well as having our Teams meets with our case managers. I feel that we had a week or so of uncertainty on how to progress after having to clarify the wants of our client- so I feel my team members and I sort of all became equal as in we were a little lost in knowing how to move forward. Once things were clarified we made adjustments and then started working on our presentation! I still coordinate when we meet as a team without our clients (since Thomas is in charge of communicating with them). I assisted in the organization of our Powerpoint, and I made sure to check the form on how we would be graded to incorportate those requirements, such as by initiating conversation on what tasks will be assigned to who.

My future plans to assist my team include reamaining the coordinator for any meetings we may need and completing the tasks I was assigned.
