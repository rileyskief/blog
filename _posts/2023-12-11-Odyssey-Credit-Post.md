By taking this class, and most importantly completing this project, I have learned extremely rewarding things. I have learned how to work on a long-term project (at least more long-term than any project I have ever partaken in with other people) with a group of people trying to learn how to be professional, become better computer scientists, and help the community. Partaking in this project has required problem-solving, accountability, and thinking outside of the box.

Cynthia and Liz were great clients. They were very understanding when life happened, yet they also didn't ask for the most simplest requests, pushing us to practice problem solving and realisticity. They often changed what they were asking us to accomplish- though this makes sense since they were also figuring out what they wanted their new Diversion program to look like. However, it made things difficult at times and required my partners and I to maintain updated notes and ideas at all times. This caused us to ask specific questions when we didn't understand, which on some days, was quite often.

This project also required a great deal of creativity. As stated above, this was a new program and therefore, it was undetermined how this website was supposed to look. Because of this open-endedness, we had to put some of our own finishing touches to make the website as user-friendly as possible (even though its just for the workers of Family Promise of Pulaski County for now) as well as visually appealing.

Accountability is something I'd say the whole class learned this semester when not only holding yourself accoutable, but also your partners. Speaking up can be difficult if someone may not be doing their part, but if everyone keeps an open mind and is open to constructive criticism, teams can grow to be as productive as possible.

Lastly, completing this project has taught me leadership and time-management. I was the designated person to coordinate times for my group's meetings. Often times, my group and I would meet on Sunday nights, usually half of us on teams, the other half in the Snoddy center. Reminding everyone that we had a meeting, whether that was reaching out in our group chat or directly to a member who was out of town, put me in a position to lead the team and encourage them to participate in that meeting. By starting a consistent meet time (Sunday nights), I feel a routine was created to encourage work to be done at that time, even when we didn't meet. Luckily, my weekends are typically very free. However, I had to find the times that the other members were free to schedule a meeting time for us to talk and update eachother.

In conclusion, I greatly enjoyed this project. It was a huge learning experience that I know has caused me to understand and explore new coding languages and ideas, working with a team, and having an assignment from a "boss" and completing it as they wish. It was a great learning experience and Service to the World Project!
