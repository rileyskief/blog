Write a post on your Jekyll Github blog that reflects on your work on this lab. What were the easiest parts of the tutorial? What were confusing parts of the tutorial? What was difficult to translate when creating your own application in Step 2? What parallels and differences do you see between the Jekyll framework and the Razor framework? How confident do you feel making another Razor application?

In your blog post, be sure to include a link to your GitHub repository for the application you created in Step 2.
