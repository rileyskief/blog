For this lab, my group and I ran into a lot of issues. Thomas was leading the group on Azure, but we struggled to figure out how to see what he was doing while working on things. All in all, completing this lab was not easy. We struggled with figuring out which app services to use. We communicated in class and through Teams the status of the lab, which was typically through Thomas. Like some previous labs, the microsoft tutorial had parts that were very vague and confusing.
