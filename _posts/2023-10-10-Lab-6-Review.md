I enjoyed completing this lab! It took me some time to ensure I was creating the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Schema correctly, but I feel this lab has helped me become more confident with this kind of stuff. While completing this lab, I often questioned the relationships between the attributes in the Entity Relationship Diagram, and it took some time to learn the ways of Vertabelo and LucidChart. Some complications I could encounter include getting confused with the various name variables, which is why I labeled them OwnerName, ItemName, CustomerName, etc. I am very satisfied with my data representation, which can be seen below:

Creating these diagrams helped map out the information so I could understand better and reference the information more quickly than glancing at a paragraph. Because I am a visual learner, I can see myself using these in the future, regardless of it being required or not.
