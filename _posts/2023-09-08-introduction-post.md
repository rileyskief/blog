Write a new post titled “Introduction Post”, describing your setup experience in this blog. What parts were new to you? What parts did you struggle with? What parts still do not make sense? What are you looking forward to? Your post must include at least two links and a list.


My setup experience with this lab did not go as smoothly as I had hoped, though I have enjoyed learning the ways to do everything. I like the creativity aspect of creating a blog post. Everything, truly, was new to me- Github, Visual Studio Code, the concepts used to create and understand how to create a blog. I struggled the most with downloading Ruby and Jekyll onto my laptop and finding out why my laptop initially rejected it. I am still trying to understand what all of the subfiles in the Blog program contribute to the website. I am looking forward to becoming more proficient and confident in completing labs like this.
