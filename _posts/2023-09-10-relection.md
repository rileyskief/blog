This revision of my blog was not bad. I had to figure out why my Visual Studio Code App was not acknowledging me editing what I thought was the correct css file. Once I figured out what my mistake with that was, it was fun to adjust the background color, font, and font color. Other than my mistakes with my css file, this revision wasn't difficult.

A big thanks goes out to [Codecademy's How to Website section on CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/closer-look-css/exercises/why-use-css), which helped me get ideas on making changes to the style.css file. Additionally, [The W3 Schools Webpage on CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) helped me to understand specific elements and ideas, such as opacity, to complete this revision.
